- I'm married to my amazing husband, Quinn. He's also a Network Administrator so if you're looking for someone with my skills and experience but with a TS/SCI, you're in luck! Quinn is on [LinkedIn](https://LinkedIn.com/in/quinton-geedey-775a7b237/).

- We live in the suburbs of Washington D.C. with our three pets 💞
  1. Bailey 🐶
